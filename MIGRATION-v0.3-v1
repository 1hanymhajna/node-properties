- "load()" and "store()" have been removed. Now "parse()" and "stringify()" can
  read and write from/to files using the "path" option.
- "stringify()" has been refactored. Now a "Stringifier" can be used to
	stringify an object if you want to add sections or comments.
- The "pretty" option has been removed from "stringify()".
- The "replacer" from "stringify()" must be a function. Cannot be an array like
	in previous versions.
