v1.0.0 (xx Jul 2013)
	Complete refactor.
	Improved reading speed by ~45%. This new version only iterates the data
		one time while the previous version was a direct port from the Java source
		code and was iterating four times over the same data.
	Improved writing speed by ~77%.
	All the dependencies have been removed.
	"load()" and "store" have been removed and "parse()" and "stringify()" can
		read and write from/to files with the "path" option.
	Added "json" option to "parse()". When it is enabled stringified json arrays
		and objects are parsed into javascript arrays and objects.
	Removed "bufferSize" and "encoding" options. Files are read using a 16KB
		buffer size and utf8 encoding.
	Removed the "pretty" option from "stringify()". The required code to
		accomplish the column limit is too complex and the feature is rarely used.
		The overall stringify speed is faster.
	The stringify replacer must be a function. Cannot be an array like in previous
		versions.
